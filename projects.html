            </h2>
            <p>March 2024 – Present</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a foundation model for 12-lead ECG with state-of-the-art performance on various public benchmark datasets.</li>
                <li>Applied the model to various ECG types, including single-lead and partial ECG, demonstrating high adaptability.</li>
                <li>Accurately recovered key ECG features, including QRS duration, heart rate, gender, and age.</li>
                <li>Used the model in an AFIB subclassification project (persistent vs. paroxysmal), achieving a 4.5% improvement in accuracy compared to our previous results.</li>
                <li>Identified misdiagnosed cases in the AFIB subclassification project, improving the quality and reliability of the labels from SNU Hospital.</li>
