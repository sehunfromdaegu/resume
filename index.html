                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematical Sciences at Seoul National University, working under the supervision of Prof. Otto van Koert. My previous research centered on applying geometric and topological concepts to deep learning. More recently, I have been focusing on developing <strong>self-supervised learning frameworks for various modalities</strong>, such as computer vision, ECG (multivariate time series), point cloud, and multimodal ECG-Chest X-Ray.
                    <br><br>
                    I have actively participated in several deep learning projects in the medical domain, contributing extensively to tasks like building <strong>ECG foundation model, ECG-based heart condition prediction, building 3D model of heart from echocardiogram</strong>, and I take pride in the impactful roles I played in these collaborations.
                    <br><br>
                    Beyond my academic and research endeavors, I am deeply interested in teaching, continuous learning, and fostering meaningful collaboration. I value effective communication and teamwork, as they have been instrumental in my research success.
                    <br><br>
                    Outside of mathematics and machine learning, I have a strong passion for boxing. It not only helps me maintain physical and mental discipline but also offers a refreshing balance to my intellectual pursuits, keeping me focused and energized.
