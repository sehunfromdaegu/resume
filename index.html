                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                <p>I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematical Sciences at Seoul National University, working under the supervision of Prof. Otto van Koert. My research focuses on applying geometrical and topological concepts in deep learning, as well as developing a theoretical understanding of deep learning. I have collaborated with medical professionals and external companies to create AI-driven solutions, such as using ECG data to predict heart conditions.
                <br><br>
                In addition to my passion for research, I am deeply interested in teaching, continuously learning new things, and engaging in meaningful communication and collaboration with others.
                <br><br>
                Outside of my academic and research interests in mathematics and machine learning, I have a strong passion for boxing. Boxing helps me stay physically and mentally disciplined, and I enjoy the challenge of improving both my technique and endurance. It provides a great balance to my intellectual pursuits, keeping me focused and energized.</p>
